# AI Tools Usage

## Tools Used

### Primary Tool: Cursor IDE with Claude AI
- **AI Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic)
- **Platform**: Cursor IDE (AI-powered code editor)
- **Cost**: Subscription-based ($20/month)
- **Usage**: Throughout entire development process

## Selection Criteria

### Why Cursor + Claude?

1. **Direct Code Integration**: Edit files directly, no copy-paste
2. **Codebase Awareness**: AI understands entire project context
3. **File Operations**: Create, read, update files seamlessly
4. **Terminal Access**: Run commands and tests instantly
5. **TypeScript Excellence**: Superior React Native and TS understanding
6. **Multi-file Edits**: Handle complex refactors across files

### Alternatives Considered
- **GitHub Copilot**: Good for autocomplete, lacks project-wide context
